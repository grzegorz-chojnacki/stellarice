# Stellarice

This is my simple [Stellaris](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/stellaris)
empire creator and rule checker.

You can check it out on my [github.io](https://grzegorz-chojnacki.github.io/stellarice)
page.

All rules were implemented according to the [wiki](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/)
as of July 2022. (bugs are to be expected)


## The reasoning

I've wanted to create a simple tool for tracking what traits, civics, ethics etc.
are available to pick, but since I don't have DLCs (and still want to play in
online sessions), I couldn't just use the built-in creator in the game.

This is only meant to show a summary of what is currently allowed to pick,
and to quickly check the rules if you are unsure why something is not available.
