# Stellarice

This is my simple empire creator and rule checker for
[Stellaris](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/stellaris).

You can check it out on my [github.io](https://grzegorz-chojnacki.github.io/stellarice)
page.

All rules were implemented according to the [wiki](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/)
and *should be* compatible with patch [3.5.3](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Patches).


## The reasoning

I've wanted to create a simple tool for tracking what traits, civics, ethics etc.
are available to pick for a given build.
Since I don't have all DLCs (but I still can play with them in online sessions),
I couldn't just use the built-in creator in the game.

This is only meant to show a summary of what is currently allowed to be picked,
and to quickly check the rules if you are unsure why something is not available.
